# Materials informatics research groups
Here is a short list (in no particular order) of groups working on materials informatics that I have worked with or know of. 
I'd like to highlight any and all groups working in the field so that it's easy for students, postdocs, and faculty to find
research opportunities and great work! Feel free to open an issue or pull request to add groups to this list.
