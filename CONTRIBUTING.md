## Guidelines
- Keep in mind that the resource list isn't meant to be comprehensive. It is opinionated and curated based on my own research experience, 
so something with functionality that is already provided by a resource in the list probably won't be added.
- Provide an entry with the format: `-[Resource name](link to resource) - Short description of resource.`
- Open a pull request modifying the [README](https://github.com/ncfrey/resources/blob/main/README.md) or open an issue with your entry.
- In the PR or issue, give a summary of what functionality the proposed resource provides that is distinct from everything else in the list, 
and why it's great!
- The research group list is meant to be comprehensive! I want to highlight any and all groups working on materials informatics. This should make
it easier for students, postdocs, and faculty in the field to find research opportunities and discover great work! If you work with or know
of a research group that isn't highlighted in the [groups list](https://github.com/ncfrey/resources/blob/main/groups.md), open a PR or an issue and let me know!
